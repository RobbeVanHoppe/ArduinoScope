# ArduinoScope

This is a very basic oscilloscope, but it shows the frequency, duty cycle, and period along with the graph.

The MCU used is an MSP430FR4133. Set up via PlatformIO plugin in CLion. It should be straightforward to add a different controller in platformio.ini folder to use this with a different MCU.

Feel free to add functionality or create a new UI all together.
